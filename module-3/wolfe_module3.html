	<h1>My Short Story</h1>
	<p>When I was 10 years old, I had a memorable experience in <span id="blank1">_____</span> the place where I was born. I would always play soccer after school and sometimes on the weekend. When it was a game day, we would play at the local  <span id="blank2">_____</span> field and my parents would be there to watch me. I remember feeling nervous as the games would start and being able to last <span id="blank3">_____</span> minutes. After the games was done, my parents would take me out to eat at a nice place if I won.  If I lost, we would still get to go somewhere nice to eat. Even when a lost, my parents always make feel like I won <span id="blank4">_____</span> because they believe having fun was more important than winning. </p>
